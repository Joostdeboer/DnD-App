## TODOs:

- [ ] Add sanity deploy/build/whatever to the github actions workflow.
- [ ] Add more content to the sanity studio and see how this affects codegen (and what commands may need to be rerun).
- [ ] Add some simple icons using e.g. https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/.
- [ ] Add custom styles (colors + gradients) to tailwind using the "primary", "secondary", etc. styles from work.
- [ ] Use atomic design folder structure from other project when creating components https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/.
- [ ] Create Figma user flows, designs, etc. and implement them!
